With the emergence of byte-addressable persistent memory (PM) and commercially available Intel OPTANE NVDIMM, PM offers new opportunities and research directions for improving the performance of key-value (KV) stores. We introduce a feasible solution to improve RocksDB via DRAM-based cache and persistent memory, which is called PC-DB. We replace the DRAM with PM in RocksDB and redesign the memtable, reducing write overhead and providing stronger consistency and faster recovery due to the absence of Write-Ahead-Log (WAL). To optimize the Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) in RocksDB, PC-DB exploits a DRAM-based cache to maintain the sequence number of outstanding transactions, providing validation in memory and avoiding to directly access disk and thus reducing the probability of transaction abort. The cache can also improve read amplification. For Two-Phase Locking (2PL), we simply use the cache to maintain the lock manager. Our expected experimental results show that our solution provides higher read and write performance, faster recovery and lower transaction abort ratio compared with RocksDB.
