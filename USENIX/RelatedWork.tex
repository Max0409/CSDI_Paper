Previous work, such as skimpystash\cite{skimpystash} and SILT\cite{SILT} ,design KV storage for SSD. 
Skimpystas uses flash as the intermediate cache to store append-only logs, 
so as to benefit from the high sequential write performance of SSD. 
SILT reduces the use of DRAM and maintains a sorted log index in memory by splitting logs across DRAM.
To conclude, these work has increased throughput through batch processing and adding software layers, 
thus enhancing sequencing.

Some previous work has redesigned LSMs for SSD. Wisckey~\cite{WiscKey} redesigned LSMs to reduce read / write amplification and use SSD bandwidth. 
VT-tree\cite{VT-tree} tree design proposes a file system and user level key value storage, which is suitable for workload independent storage. Wang et al.\cite{Wang} exposed I / O channel information of SSDs to leveldb to utilize parallel bandwidth.

NoveLSM\cite{DBLP:conf/usenix/KannanBGAA18} is a persistent KV storage system based on LSM, which aims to utilize non-volatile memory and provide low latency and high throughput for applications. 
It stores the the MemTable and Immutable MemTable in both DRAM and PM for performance and better recovery.
