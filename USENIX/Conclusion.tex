In this paper, we presented the Persistent-Consistent DB(PC-DB) that use PM to store the MemTable and Immutable MemTable, thus providing faster recovery and better consistency. At the same time, PC-DB make use of the DRAM as a cache for outstanding transaction version, solving the problem of the read amplification in the validation phase of OCC. Our experiments shows that PC-DB performs well in the  YCSB, which are real world workload benchmarks.
